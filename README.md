Online Food Ordering Service
	
Online food delivery service is a web-based application that allows users to order food online. 
The system typically consists of two main components: a front-end user interface that allows customers to browse menus, select items, and place orders, and a back-end management system that handles order processing, restaurant management, and delivery logistics. 
The system will be easy to use, secure, and scalable to accommodate future growth.
